    "# ULMFiT for Genomics Classification\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying functional genomic regions such as promoters or enhancers from sequence data alone is a notoriously difficult challenge. Many bioinformatics algorithms exist for genomics classification, but these tend to rely on many hand engineered features. More recently, deep learning approaches developed in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) have been applied to genomics problems with promising results [26]. However, these methods tend to be limited by the amount of labeled data available. We present Genomic-ULMFiT, an application of Universal Language Model for Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) [1] to genomics classification problems. ULMFiT is an effective NLP algorithm for inductive transfer learning that utilizes pre-training on large unlabeled corpuses. This is particularly advantageous in the context of genomics data, which tends to contain significant volumes of unlabeled data. Genomic-ULMFiT shows improved results over existing methods for classification of promoters, enhancers, taxonomy, and lncRNA using only sequence data."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Advancements in genomics research such as high-throughput sequencing have driven an explosion of genomic data. The mountain of data demands robust algorithms to analyze and interpret the data. Classification - asigning genomic sequences a label based on their function - is fundamental to processing raw genomics data. Algorithms exist to classify sequences based on hand engineered features, but these approaches struggle with the structural heterogeneity of genomic sequences [6]. Structures of genomic regulatory features such as promoters are notoriously complex and diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently deep learning approaches have tried to leverage large genomics datasets to train end-to-end models to resolve the complex structural diversity of genomic sequences. In the context of classification problems, deep learning has been applied to promoter classification [5,6], enhancer classification [3,4,7,12], enhancer-promoter interactions [8], CRISPR guide scoring [2], transcription factor binding sites [9], metagenomics classification [10], delitrious mutation classification [11], and long noncoding RNA classification [27]. One limitation of these methods as implemented is they all rely on labled data. When techniques like pre-training and transfer learning are used, such steps are used only on labeled classification corpuses. This poses a problem, as labeled genomics datasets tend to be small and deep learning models are prone to overfitting on small datasets [31].\n",
    "\n",
    "ULMFiT is a NLP algorithm for training text classification models using transfer learning. ULMFiT uses unsupervised pre-training on large unlabeled domain corpuses to improve classification on smaller labeled datasets. This approach has shown to reduce error rate on common text classification tasks by 18-24% over training from scratch, while also reducing data requirements by up to 100x [1]. In the context of genomic data, ULMFiT allows us to pre-train models on large amounts of unlabeled sequence data, then use the pre-trained models for classification on smaller corpuses of labeled data. This helps address the limitations caused by labeled sequence availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapt ULMFiT to genomics data with k-mer based tokenization. We show that Genomic-ULMFiT produces superior classification results in several genomic contexts, improving metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall by up to 18%. We provide a roadmap for approaching genomics classification problems in any genomic context using unsupervised pre-training."

    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning in Genomics\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has been applied to many areas of genomics for some time now [26]. Deep classification models have been applied to a variety of genomics classification problems such as promoter classification [5,6], enhancer classification [3,4,7,12], enhancer-promoter interactions [8], CRISPR guide scoring [2], transcription factor binding sites [9], metagenomics classification [10], delitrious mutation classification [11], and long noncoding RNA classification [27] to name a few. Deep models for genomics typically use CNN based architectures [2,3,5,6,7,10] or GRU cell architectures [4,9,27]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Representation of Genomic Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "An important design decision in training deep genomics models is choosing how to represent genomic sequences as a numerical input to the model. Genomic sequences are typically tokenized on the nucleotide level [2,3,4,5,6,7,27]. Some approaches tokenize on the k-mer level [8,9,10]. Tokenized sequences are then represented either as one hot encoded vectors [2,3,4,5,6,7,10] or passed through an embedding [8,9,27].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is the task of taking in as input a sequence of tokens, and predicting the next token in the sequence. Language modeling in NLP has proven to be a powerful pre-training tool for transfer learning. Language modeling as a task trains a model to learn long term dependencies, hierarchical relations and sentiment [1]. Language models have shown the ability to be fine-tuned to many different classification tasks related to the language domain the language model was trained on [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ULMFiT\n",
    "\n",
    "ULMFiT is an inductive transfer learning technique in NLP [1]. ULMFiT trains a text classification model in three steps. The first step is general domain language modeling. A language model is trained on a large, general, unlabeled corpus that shares domain similarities to the classification task. The second step is to fine tune the general language model on the classification corpus. The third step is to use the pre-trained weights of the fine tuned language model to train the final classification model on the classification corpus. The ULMFiT approach has shown to train better performing classification models requiring smaller amounts of labeled data compared to training from scratch [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models can be prone to overfitting. [13] showed that using a variety of effective regularization techniques is crucial for training high quality language models that do not overfit. Dropout is applied in four different ways. Embedding dropout is the equivalent of applying dropout on the word level, broadcasting dropout along the entire embedding vector for a word with a given probability. Weight dropout, similar to DropConnect [19] is applied to the hidden-to-hidden matrices of the LSTM layers of the model. For weight drop, a constant dropout mask is applied at all timesteps to avoid issues raised by [18]. Variational dropout is applied to the activations of the hidden layers, also using a constant dropout mask at all timesteps. Standard dropout is used on linear layers after LSTM layers. Two forms of activation regularization are also applied. Activation Regularization (AR) applies an L2 scale penalty to the activations in the LSTM layers of the model. Temporal Activation Regularization (TAR) applies an L2 penalty to the change in activation scale between timesteps."

    "## 3. Genomic ULMFiT\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose Genomic ULMFiT - an adaptation of the ULMFiT training process to genomic data. Following the ULMFiT process, we first train a general domain genomic language model. This genomic language model takes in a sequence of genomic tokens and predicts the next token in the sequence. The genomic language model is then fine tuned on a target classification corpus to create a fine tuned genomic language model. The weights of the fine tuned genomic language model are then transferred to a classification model that is trained on the target classification corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of datasets are used in the ULMFiT process. The first is the dataset used for training the general domain genomic language model. The second is the dataset used for the target classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the general domain language model is a self-supervised process. The model takes in a sequence of tokens and predicts the next token. This training stage required no labeled data. This allows us to take advantage of the large amounts of unlabeled genomic data available. To create datasets for training the general domain genomic language model, full genomes are downloaded from NCBI. This makes it easy to generate large genomic datasets. The dataset used for pre-training should be phylogenically similar to the target classification task the model will be transferred to. If for example the target task was classifying human promoter sequences, the general domain genomic language model should be trained on human genomic data or genomic data from closely related species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets used for classification tasks are taken from existing publications for comparison. This is discussed more in the results section. In short, classification datasets are taken from [5,6,7,10,27].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic data must be pre-processed and tokenized before being input to the model. Tokenization on the k-mer level following [8,9,10] leads to better performance than nucleotide level tokenization used by [2,3,4,5,6,7,27]. k-mer level tokenization allows the language model to learn a more nuanced understanding of different k-mers compared to nucleotide level tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is also done with a set stride between tokens that may be less than the k-mer value. For example consider tokenizing the sequence `ATCGCGTACGATCCG` with a k-mer size of 4 and the following stride values:\n",
    " * Stride 1: `ATCG TCGC CGCG GCGT CGTA GTAC TACG ACGA CGAT GATC ATCC TCCG`\n",
    " * Stride 2: `ATCG CGCG CGTA TACG CGAT ATCC`\n",
    " * Stride 3: `ATCG GCGT TACG GATC`\n",
    " * Stride 4: `ATCG CGTA CGAT`\n",
    "\n",
    "Decreasing the stride between k-mers can be thought of as applying a prior to the language model prediction process where information about the next k-mer is included in the previous k-mer. This allows the language model to converge more quickly to a lower loss value, but this does not always translate to better classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, tokenization parameters for the length of k-mers used and the stride between k-mers are hyperparameters that must be tuned for different datasets. Some datasets respond strongly to the choice of k-mer and stride, while other datasets show no performance change for a range of k-mer and stride values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Domain Genomic Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The general domain genomic language model is based on the AWD-LSTM model [13] which is the standard model for ULMFiT [1]. The model is regularized following [13]. All forms of dropout described in [13] are used - variational dropout, weight-drop, embedding dropout and standard dropout. Activation regularization, temporal activation regularization and weight decay are also used. Weight decay is implemented following [20] where the weight decay penalty is added in the weight update step rather than in the loss calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general domain genomic language model is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the next genomic token in a series of genomic tokens. Typical datasets include an organism's genome, or an ensemble of genomes from closely related organisms. The model is trained following the One Cycle learning rate policy from [22]. Learning rates are selected following the methods of [23,24]. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with parameters $\\beta_{1} = 0.9, \\beta_{2} = 0.99$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Specific Genomic Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how good the general domain genomic language model is, the classification dataset likely comes from a different distribution [1]. This motivates fine-tuning the genomic language model on the classification corpus. Following [1], the genomic language model is fine-tuned using discriminative fine-tuning where different layers in the model receive different learning rates and are fine-tuned to different extents. In this stage, regularization hyperparameters may need to be changed. The model is still trained following the One Cycle learning rate policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Specific Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights from the fine-tuned genomic langauge model are then transferred to the classification model. The classification model adds two new linear layers on top of the genomic language model. Following [1], the linear layers use batch normalization, dropout and ReLU activations. The linear layers use the concat pooling method described in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification model is trained using gradual unfreezing. Training all layers of the classification model at once could lead to catastrophic forgetting. Training all layers also risks allowing a bad gradient update in the new, untrained linear layers to dramatically change the pre-trained weights in the lower layers of the model. With gradual unfreezing, we first train only the new linear layers at the end of the model. Then we unfreeze one layer at a time over several training steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Models typically include an embedding of size 400, three LSTM layers with 1150 hidden activations per layer, and a BPTT value of 70. Typical dropout parameters are 0.1 for embeddings, 0.5 for the LSTM hidden-to-hidden matrix, 0.2 to the activations of the LSTM layers and 0.4 to the output linear layers. Activation regularization and temporal activation regularization are implemented with parameters $\\alpha = 2$, $\\beta = 1$. The weight decay coefficient is typically 0.01. Dropout and weight decay are tuned on a per-dataset basis. Typically dropout parameters are tuned by applying a constant scaling coefficient, maintaining the ratios between dropout parameters."

The Genomic Ensemble Pre-Training model is trained on a dozen or so bacterial genomes. Pre-training has a clear impact on model performance.
