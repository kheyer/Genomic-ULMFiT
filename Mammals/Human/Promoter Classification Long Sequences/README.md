# Human Promoter Classification with Long Sequences

This series of notebooks looks at training human promoter classification models for long sequences following the ULMFiT approach. Short here 
is defined as -500/500 relative to known TSS sites. The dataset is constructed following the method outlined in [PromID: Human Promoter Prediction by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01414.pdf) 
by Umarov et al.  Promoter sequences are generated by locating TSS sites listed in the [EPDnew Database](ftp://ccg.vital-it.ch/epdnew/human/006/) 
and taking the sequence retion -500/500 relative to the TSS. Negative examples are taken from random regions in the genome not containing 
a defined TSS region. The [NCBI Human Genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/51) is used as a reference template.

Notebook __0__ details preparation of the dataset.

The notebooks in this folder look at training a classification model using the different stages of the ULMFiT process. 

Notebook __1__ trains a naive baseline model. This model trains from scratch using only the promoter sequences dataset.

Notebook __2__ trains the classification model initialized with a pretrained [human genome language model](https://github.com/kheyer/Genomic-ULMFiT/tree/master/Mammals/Human/Genomic%20Language%20Models).

Notebook __3__ first fine tunes the human genome language model on the promoter corpus, then trains a classification model intitialized with 
the fine tuned language model. The 5-mer stride 2 language model is used.

Notebook __4__ follows the same training procedure to Notebook __3__, except it uses the 4-mer stride 2 language model.

Notebook __5__ follows the same training procedure as Notebook __3__ and Notebook __4__, using the 8-mer stride 3 language model.
